South Africa beat Australia in the 2nd T20I

The shortest format of the game is known for producing high-octane action, breathtaking strokeplay, and unforgettable individual performances. The second T20I between Australia and South Africa at the Marrara Cricket Ground in Darwin ticked all those boxes, with young sensation Dewald Brevis delivering an innings that left spectators and viewers in awe.

Dewald Brevis delivers a masterclass in Darwin
The young South African star produced a batting spectacle, smashing an unbeaten 125 off just 56 deliveries, decorated with 12 fours and 8 sixes. His innings began steadily, reaching fifty off 25 balls, before exploding into a 41-ball century — the second fastest by a South African in T20Is.

Brevis, nicknamed ‘Baby AB’ for his similarities to AB de Villiers, was in complete control, punishing every loose ball and dismantling the Australian bowling attack. Just days after scoring only 2 runs in the opening match, the right-hander bounced back in style, powering South Africa to an imposing total of 218/7. His breathtaking knock not only levelled the three-match series 1-1 but also silenced the home crowd.

Australia falter in the chase
Chasing 219, Australia’s innings never gained momentum. The hosts lost two wickets for just 29 runs, putting early pressure on their middle order. Captain Mitchell Marsh and Tim David added 48 runs for the third wicket, briefly raising hopes of a turnaround. However, Marsh’s dismissal for 22 at the hands of Corbin Bosch triggered a collapse.

David fought hard with a brisk 50, but his wicket soon after ended Australia’s resistance. The lower order couldn’t handle South Africa’s disciplined bowling, and the hosts were bundled out for 165, falling 53 runs short of the target.
